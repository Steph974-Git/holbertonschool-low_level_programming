# C - More functions, more nested loops

This project extends your knowledge of functions and nested loops in C programming. You'll build upon the fundamentals learned previously, implementing more complex functions and exploring advanced looping techniques.

## Learning Objectives

- Implementing multiple functions with different purposes
- Creating advanced nested loop structures
- Understanding function prototypes and their importance
- Practicing proper code organization and documentation
- Mastering character manipulation and checking techniques
- Applying number printing patterns and sequences

## Tasks Overview

### 0. isupper
**Check for uppercase character**

Write a function that checks if a character is uppercase:
1. Compare the character with ASCII range for uppercase letters ('A' to 'Z')
2. Return 1 if uppercase, 0 otherwise

### 1. isdigit
**Check for a digit**

Create a function that determines if a character is a digit (0-9):
1. Check if the character falls within the ASCII range for digits
2. Return 1 if it's a digit, 0 otherwise

### 2. mul
**Multiply two integers**

Implement a simple function that multiplies two integers and returns the result.

### 3. The numbers speak for themselves
**Print numbers from 0 to 9**

Write a function that prints numbers from 0 to 9 followed by a new line:
1. Use a loop to iterate through the digits
2. Use _putchar to print each number
3. Add a newline character at the end

### 4. I believe in numbers and signs
**Print most numbers**

Create a function that prints numbers 0 to 9 (except 2 and 4):
1. Use a loop with a conditional to skip 2 and 4
2. Use _putchar to print each eligible number
3. End with a newline character

### 5. Numbers constitute the only universal language
**Print numbers 0-14 ten times**

Implement a function that prints numbers 0 to 14 ten times:
1. Use a nested loop structure (outer loop for repetition)
2. Inner loop prints the sequence of numbers
3. Add a newline after each complete sequence

### 6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line
**Draw a line in the terminal**

Write a function that prints a straight line using the _ character:
1. Accept a parameter for line length
2. Use a loop to print the appropriate number of characters
3. Handle edge cases (zero or negative length)

### 7. I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe
**Draw a diagonal line**

Create a function that prints a diagonal line using the \ character:
1. Accept a parameter for the number of lines
2. Use nested loops to create proper spacing and placement
3. Handle edge cases appropriately

### 8. You are so much sunshine in every square inch
**Print a square**

Implement a function that prints a square pattern using the # character:
1. Accept a size parameter
2. Use nested loops for rows and columns
3. Format the output properly with newlines
4. Handle special cases for zero or negative size

### 9. Fizz-Buzz
**Print Fizz-Buzz sequence**

Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100 with special rules:
1. Replace multiples of 3 with "Fizz"
2. Replace multiples of 5 with "Buzz"
3. Replace multiples of both with "FizzBuzz"
4. Format output with spaces and proper newlines

## Conclusion

This project builds upon your previous knowledge of functions and loops, introducing more complex programming patterns and techniques. Mastering these concepts will strengthen your foundation in C programming and prepare you for even more challenging tasks ahead.
