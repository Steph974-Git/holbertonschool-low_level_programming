# Shell and C Programming Projects

This repository contains a series of projects covering fundamental concepts in both Shell scripting and the C programming language. These projects are designed to build a strong foundation in system programming and scripting by exploring essential topics such as shell basics, file permissions, input/output redirections, loops, recursion, and more.

## Projects Included

### Shell Scripting
- **Shell basics** – Introduction to the command line and basic shell commands.
- **Shell permissions** – Managing file and directory permissions in Linux.
- **Shell I/O Redirections and filters** – Handling input, output, and data manipulation.
- **Shell init files, variables, and expansions** – Customizing the shell environment and managing variables.

### C Programming
- **C - Hello, World** – Introduction to the C language and its compilation process.
- **C - Variables, if, else, while** – Basics of variables, conditionals, and loops.
- **C - Functions, nested loops** – Understanding functions and nested loops in C.
- **C - More functions, more nested loops** – Advanced looping techniques and function usage.
- **C - Pointers, arrays, and strings** – Introduction to pointers and memory manipulation.
- **C - More pointers, arrays, and strings** – Deeper exploration of pointers and arrays.
- **C - Even more pointers, arrays, and strings** – Complex pointer operations and string handling.
- **C - Recursion** – Implementing recursive functions in C.
- **C - argc, argv** – Command-line argument handling in C programs.

## Future Additions
Additional topics and projects will be added over time to expand on more advanced concepts.

## Requirements
- A Unix-based operating system (Linux/macOS)
- Bash shell
- GCC compiler for C programming
