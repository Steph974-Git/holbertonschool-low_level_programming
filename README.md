# Holberton School Low Level Programming

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of projects focused on low-level programming in C. From basic concepts to advanced topics, these projects build a solid foundation in systems programming, memory management, data structures, and algorithm implementation.

## Projects Overview

### Foundations
- **C - Hello, World** – Introduction to C programming language, compilation process, and basic syntax
- **C - Variables, if, else, while** – Fundamentals of variables, conditional statements, and looping constructs
- **C - Functions, nested loops** – Creating and using functions, understanding scope, implementing nested loops
- **C - Debugging** – Techniques for finding and fixing errors in C code

### Memory Management
- **C - Pointers, arrays and strings** – Understanding memory addresses, pointer manipulation, and string handling
- **C - More pointers, arrays and strings** – Advanced pointer operations and multi-dimensional arrays
- **C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings** – Complex pointer arithmetic and memory manipulation

### Memory Allocation
- **C - malloc, free** – Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation
- **C - More malloc, free** – Advanced memory management techniques using calloc, realloc

### Recursion and Arguments
- **C - Recursion** – Implementing and understanding recursive algorithms
- **C - argc, argv** – Handling command line arguments in C programs

### Data Structures
- **C - Singly linked lists** – Creating and manipulating linked data structures
- **C - Doubly linked lists** – Implementation of bidirectional linked lists
- **C - Hash tables** – Understanding hash functions and collision resolution
- **C - Binary trees** – Working with hierarchical data structures

### Algorithms
- **C - Sorting algorithms** – Implementation and analysis of various sorting techniques
- **C - Search algorithms** – Different approaches to searching data

### System Programming
- **C - File I/O** – File handling, descriptors, and system calls
- **C - Bit manipulation** – Operations on individual bits
- **C - Static libraries** – Creating and using static libraries
- **C - Dynamic libraries** – Working with shared libraries
- **C - Function pointers** – Using pointers to functions and callback mechanisms
- **C - Variadic functions** – Handling variable argument lists

### Shell Projects
- **Shell basics** – Introduction to the command line interface
- **Shell permissions** – Understanding and managing file permissions
- **Shell I/O Redirections and filters** – Input/output manipulation and data processing
- **Shell init files, variables, and expansions** – Environment configuration and shell customization

## Learning Objectives

Through these projects, you'll gain:
- Strong understanding of C programming fundamentals
- Memory management skills essential for systems programming
- Experience implementing common data structures from scratch
- Understanding of algorithmic complexity and optimization
- Knowledge of both high-level concepts and low-level implementation details
- Debugging and testing abilities for robust code development

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- gcc compiler with the following flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- Betty style compliance for all C code

## Usage

Each project directory contains:
- A specific README with detailed requirements
- Source files implementing the required functionality
- Header files with function prototypes
- Test files for validating the implementations
